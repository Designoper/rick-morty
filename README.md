# Rick and Morty WEBAPP

## Scope

This webapp

## Tech stack

The technology used to create this project is:

* Rick and morty API: this API provides all the data from the Rick and Morty show. It provides three major information blocks: characthers, locations and episodes. Documentation of the API can be found in [https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation).

* HTML: the markup language that describes the structure of the website and links to other resources (CSS, Javascript, images...).

* CSS: the style sheet language that gives the webapp it's look (colors, padding, layout...) and allows responsiveness (correct adaptation of content to any screen no matter the device).

* Javascript: the only programming language available for the browser (client side). In this webapp, it allows to fetch content from the API, update the DOM with the content recieved, update the fetch url according to the user input and implement infinite scrolling.

* Git: the most popular open source control version system to track changes in the source code of software development. It allows collaboration between multiple users.

* Github: the most famous platform to host Git repositories. This is where all the code of the webapp is stored.

* Github Pages: a the static site hosting service from Github that allows to use repositories as websites, as long as the content is only front-end technology. Since it's free, easy to use, and this project fits that criteria (the back-end is hosted elsewhere and we access it thanks to the API) it's the perfect choice to have a functioning public version of the project.
