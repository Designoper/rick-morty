# Rick and Morty WEBAPP

## Scope

This webapp

## Tech stack

The technology used to create this project is:

* Rick and morty API: this API provides all the data from the Rick and Morty show. It provides three major information blocks: characthers, locations and episodes. Documentation of the API can be found in [https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation).

* HTML:

* CSS: gives the webapp it's look (colors, )

* Javascript: the only programming language available for the browser (client side). In this webapp, it allows to fetch content from the API, update the DOM with the content recieved, update the fetch url according to the user input and implement infinite scrolling.

* Git: the most popular open source control version tool

* Github: the most famous platform to host Git repositories. This is where all the code of the webapp is stored.

* Github Pages: a functionality from Github that allows to use repositories as websites, as long as the content is only front-end technology. Since this project fits that criteria (the back-end is hosted elsewhere and we access it thanks to the API) and it's free and easy to use, it's the perfect choice to have a functioning public version of the webapp.
